# Flat Field Maker
[EN] A little C++ (Qt) program to make Flat-Field images out of multiple not-so-flat images.

[FR] Un petit programme en C++ (Qt) pour générer des images Flat-Field à partir de plusieurs images pas si flat que ça.

## How to use it?
1. Add images that you want to use to generate the flat. If these images are not flat at all, you should use many of them, if they are flat enough, only a few should do.
2. Create and save the flat.
3. Apply the flat field on any picture you want.
4. If you want to create a new flat from other pictures, delete the pictures that are still in the programs memory with the appropriate button.

## DISCLAIMER
This program only creates flat-fields which correct vignetting, and nothing else. And only if this vignetting is centered on the pictures (which should be the case).
## DISCLAIMER 2
It's late. So my English is bad. And my ability to explain how to use this program is half-asleep. So sorry if this README file is useless.
